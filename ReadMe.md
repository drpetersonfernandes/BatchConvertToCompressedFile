## Overview

Batch Convert to Compressed File is a Windows application that provides a simple user interface for compressing multiple files into individual archives and verifying the integrity of existing compressed files. It uses **7-Zip** for `.7z` compression and built-in .NET libraries for `.zip` compression, while providing a user-friendly interface for batch processing. It also supports parallel processing for improved performance and comprehensive archive verification.

## Features

- **Batch Compression**: Compress multiple files into individual archives in a single operation.
- **Multiple Format Support**: Create `.7z` archives using 7-Zip or `.zip` archives using built-in .NET compression.
- **Archive Verification**: Verify the integrity of `.7z`, `.zip`, and `.rar` archives with comprehensive CRC checking.
- **7-Zip Integration**: Uses `7z.exe` for `.7z` compression, included with the application.
- **Parallel Processing**: Optionally process multiple files in parallel to speed up batch operations.
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress indication, real-time logging, and write speed monitoring during operations.
- **Delete Original Option**: Option to remove source files after successful compression.
- **File Organization**: Automatically move verified archives to success or failed folders.
- **Global Error Reporting**: Automatic bug reporting to the developer with comprehensive error details.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive tabbed Windows interface with real-time statistics.

## Supported File Formats

### Compression Output
- **.7z files** (7-Zip archives)
- **.zip files** (ZIP archives)

### Verification Support

4. **Choose Output Format**: Select either ".7z" or ".zip" format for the compressed archives.
5. **Delete Option**: Check "Delete original files after successful compression" if you want to remove source files after compression.
6. **Parallel Processing Option**: Check "Enable parallel processing" to compress multiple files concurrently for faster batch completion.
7. **Start Compression**: Click "Start Compression" to begin the batch process.
8. **Monitor Progress**: The application displays progress bars, write speed, and detailed log messages for each file during compression.
9. **Cancel (if needed)**: Click "Cancel" to stop the ongoing compression process gracefully.

### Verifying Archives

1. **Select the "Verify Archives" tab**.
2. **Select Archives Folder**: Click "Browse" next to "Archives Folder" to select the folder containing archives to verify.

4. **Move Options**: Optionally configure moving successfully verified or failed archives to separate folders.
5. **Start Verification**: Click "Start Verification" to begin the verification process.
6. **Monitor Progress**: The application displays detailed verification results and statistics.

## About Compressed File Formats

### 7-Zip (.7z)
The 7z format is an open-source archive format that offers several advantages:

- **Superior Compression**: Often achieves better compression ratios than ZIP and RAR formats.
- **Multiple Compression Methods**: Supports LZMA, LZMA2, and other advanced compression algorithms.
- **Strong Encryption**: AES-256 encryption support for secure archives.
- **Unicode Support**: Proper handling of international file names.

### ZIP (.zip)
The ZIP format is a widely supported archive format that provides:

- **Universal Compatibility**: Supported natively by Windows and most operating systems.
- **Fast Compression**: Quick compression and decompression using built-in .NET libraries.
- **Wide Software Support**: Compatible with virtually all archive management tools.

## Why Use This Tool?

- **Save Time**: Batch process multiple files instead of compressing them one by one.
- **Save Disk Space**: Compressed files take up significantly less storage space.
- **Verify Integrity**: Ensure your archives are not corrupted and can be safely extracted.
- **Organize Files**: Automatically organize verified archives into success and failed folders.
- **Performance**: Parallel processing capabilities for faster batch operations.
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and comprehensive logging for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure `7z.exe` and `7z.dll` are present in the same directory as the application for .7z compression.
- Make sure you have appropriate permissions to read from the input and write to the output directories.
- If .7z compression is failing, verify that `7z.exe` is not missing or corrupted.
- Review the application log window for detailed error messages during operations.
- Automatic error reports will be sent to the developer if unexpected issues occur.
- For verification issues, ensure the archive files are not in use by other applications.
