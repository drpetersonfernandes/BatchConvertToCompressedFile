## About Compressed File Formats

### 7-Zip (.7z)
The 7z format is an open-source archive format that offers several advantages:
- **Superior Compression**: Often achieves better compression ratios than the ZIP and RAR formats.
- **Multiple Compression Methods**: Supports LZMA, LZMA2, and other advanced compression algorithms.
- **Strong Encryption**: AES-256 encryption support for secure archives.
- **Unicode Support**: Proper handling of international filenames.

### ZIP (.zip)
The ZIP format is a widely supported archive format that provides:
- **Universal Compatibility**: Supported natively by Windows and most operating systems.
- **Fast Compression**: Quick compression and decompression using built-in .NET libraries.
- **Wide Software Support**: Compatible with virtually all archive management tools.

## Why Use This Tool?
- **Save Time**: Batch process multiple files instead of compressing them one by one.
- **Save Disk Space**: Compressed files take up significantly less storage space.
- **Verify Integrity**: Ensure your archives are not corrupted and can be safely extracted.
- **Organize Files**: Automatically organize verified archives into "Success" and "Failed" folders.
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and comprehensive logging for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure `7z.dll` is present in the same directory as the application for .7z compression.
- Make sure you have appropriate permissions to read from the input and write to the output directories.
- Review the application log window for detailed error messages during operations.
- Automatic error reports will be sent to the developer if unexpected issues occur.
- For verification issues, ensure the archive files are not in use by other applications.
